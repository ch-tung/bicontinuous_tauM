### `./`

* `in.virial_all`: LAMMPS input file, generates the particle trajectories as well as the per-particle stress tensors.

### `./corr/`

2-point/4-point spatial-temporal correlations of local stress/structure

### `./tcorr/`

Time correlations in aligned/misaligned regions

* #### `./tcorr/SD/`

  Squared deviations in aligned/misaligned regions (*Fig. 4*).
